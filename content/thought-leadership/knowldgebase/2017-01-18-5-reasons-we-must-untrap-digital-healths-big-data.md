What is not appreciated by most in healthcare is that there is a lot of Big Data collected but most is not relevant data, nor is it easily located or even accessible. The implications of this are enormous. The true value proposition of Big Data in healthcare lies in how the data is analyzed and presented. In my last post I discussed ways in which Big Data can be transformed into relevant data. I will discuss five reasons why freeing up trapped data is critical to making it relevant."

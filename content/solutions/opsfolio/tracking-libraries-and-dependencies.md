#### Is the third-party code in your apps safe to use?

![Is-the-third-party-code-in-your-apps-safe-to-use](img/solutions/opsfolio/Is-the-third-party-code-in-your-apps-safe-to-use.jpg#right)

Many developers believe that the open source or custom third-party code they integrate into their code is secure because it’s been used by many others. Just because third-party software passes through many hands doesn’t mean it’s safe. It still must be monitored and checked for security vulnerabilities.

Security flaws in these utilities can affect software that runs on servers, desktop computers, mobile devices, the Internet and hardware appliances—and affect the operations of millions of businesses.

Not knowing where your third-party libraries and open-source code components are isn’t just an information management problem. It can become a security problem

Use Opsfolio to:

* **Continuously monitor** all your applications and check third-party libraries for vulnerabilities and security updates.
* **Perform continuous and periodic checks** for security updates and patches for the third party libraries and components used in your application.
* **Avoid the cost and effort** of manual or DIY vulnerability tracking solutions.

Opsfolio helps you find and reduce the biggest security risks to your code.

#### Manage software dependencies.

As developers use more and more libraries and components, it’s harder to identify, track and manage them. When dependency issues come up (and they always do), compatibility problems and runtime errors can bring your development work schedule to a halt.
Opsfolio provides a structured approach to managing software dependencies.

Use Opsfolio to:

* **Provide a centralized repository** to store all information about the libraries and components used in your software.
* **Keep a record** of which versions of the libraries are being used and when they were last updated.
* **Virtually eliminate** the time and human effort needed to manually track the software dependencies used in your code.


#### Find every vulnerable component in your application.

Finding vulnerable components in your app requires a complete list of the latest mailing lists and announcements for every third-party component used in your app. But even if you had this information, would you have the time to search through and use it?

Opsfolio automates the process of finding vulnerable components by:

* **Monitoring** all the latest publicly available feeds, news and announcements for vulnerabilities and security flaws relevant to your third-party code.
* **Notifying** you immediately if there is a security flaw or a vulnerability in any of the software components you are using.

Opsfolio security monitoring helps you find vulnerable components quickly and accurately and minimizes the resources you use to find it.

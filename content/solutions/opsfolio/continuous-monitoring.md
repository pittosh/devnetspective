Opsfolio CM (“continuous monitoring”) is probably the most important part of our suite. Experienced technicians use our security operations center (SOC) to remotely monitor your IT infrastructure. We use the SOC to track changes as well as identify and prevent new risks from occurring. Our personnel and tools continuously monitor ongoing security threats by collecting log data and monitoring changes in your environment.

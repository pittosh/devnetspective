Netspective Opsfolio Audit for FDA provides the guidance and insight needed to meet FDA compliance requirements. In our FDA audits, our consultants:

Evaluate the classification of medical devices to identify appropriate regulations.

Identify predicate devices that are similar and already have a FDA 510(k) clearance. Then they judge whether these devices can be used in the 510(k) Premarket submission for the medical device.

Review FDA compliance, guidance, standards, testing and other specific requirements needed to claim substantial equivalence to predicate devices.

Build and maintain a compliance program that satisfies current requirements.

Easily manage assets and processes when standards change.

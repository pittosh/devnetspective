Netspective Opsfolio Audit for FISMA and FedRAMP helps identify the information controls that are required for the assets and procedures used in an organizationâ€™s unique operations. In each audit, our consultants:

Categorize each IT system and process and match them to the appropriate risk controls. Then, summarize the controls that match the IT assets and procedures.

Perform a gap analysis of FISMA requirements and organization policies, procedures and IT assets. Then summarize how well the current infrastructure satisfies FISMA requirements.

Perform risk impact assessment using NIST standards. This includes using new NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards for the New Authorization Process, Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) process.

Assess the compliance risk of the IT assets and FISMA procedures. Use risk assessment results to identity and justify funds for more effective security solutions

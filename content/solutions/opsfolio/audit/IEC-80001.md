Computer-controlled medical devices such as smart infusion pumps and alarm notification systems are increasingly available. More and more of these devices—which often configure themselves and identify and resolve problems automatically—are migrating to centralized enterprise networks.

These innovations make healthcare operations more capable and efficient. But, they also add multiple points of failure. These entry points of trouble often reduce patient safety and clinical data security.

Managing medical IT systems and complying with related regulations and standards take more time and effort than ever. Usually, that means:

Checking the effect of adding medical devices to your current IT infrastructure.

Having to check possible changes in medical device behavior every time you change the design of your network,

Having to check whether your medical IT device or system is in compliance every time the rules change.

If you fail to check changes diligently, patient safety or IT system security might be at risk.

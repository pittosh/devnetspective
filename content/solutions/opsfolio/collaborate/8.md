In addition to keeping a well documented asset inventory, Opsfolio has a RACI matrix tied to each of your assets. This matrix gives you a firsthand information of which roles are participating in the decision making processes concerning each asset. It tells you who should be informed or consulted on assets, and who would be responsible or accountable, so that they can answer questions that you have for them.

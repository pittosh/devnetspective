Loss of data due to fraud and data breaches caused by malicious insiders can wreak havoc on your company’s brand value and customer loyalty. If your company’s name turns up in the news for reasons such as data breaches, then the stock prices are going to go down and it is going to turn your good customers away.

Opsfolio continuously watches networks for malicious activity, tracks new devices added to the network, tracks new applications added to the existing devices, watches for updates to your software libraries and components and notifies you of any suspicious activity.

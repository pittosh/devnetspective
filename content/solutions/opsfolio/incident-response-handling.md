Many organizations have a security response plan. But poor design and inconsistent implementation often prevent its being used.

Why is that?

* Plans are often scoped too small. Many security plans and strategies are not designed to respond to organization-wide incidents. Only one or two people know what’s going on.
* Standards and regulations keep changing. You get in compliance, but before you know it, the rules—and your compliance status—change. Some organizations don’t have the resources they need to keep up.
* Many organizations lack specialized knowledge and tools. Planning for and responding to security incidents—and staying legal—requires up-to-date resources.

Netspective tools and services can help you make or update your security incident response plan, quickly and effectively. Effective security incidence response plans must begin long before a breach occurs. Planning is the only way to reduce the number, severity and impact of security incidents. Effective plans help you:

* **Prepare your organization** by defining responsibilities and roles of the staff, helping you plan resources you’ll need and providing step-by-step guidance when a breach occurs.
* **Detect and analyze incidents** quickly and efficiently. That includes deciding the scope and root causes of the incident.
* **Decide how to notify affected parties.** That includes whether the breach requires notification, which entities to notify and whether to make the notification public.
* **Contain and remove the breach and recover from the incident.** Containment is necessary before any further damage occurs. And, you must remove and replace infected machines.

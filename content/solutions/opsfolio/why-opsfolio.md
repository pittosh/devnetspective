**Protecting your network and data has never been easy, and it’s only getting harder:**

* Security attacks are increasing and hackers are getting more brazen.
* Regulatory requirements are growing, making compliance a moving target.
* Penalties for breaches and non-compliance are getting stiffer.
* Business, technical, and data risk identification and remediation are now a necessity.
* Lack of well-designed and automated incident response processes for detecting security vulnerabilities and handling breaches.

**It’s what you don’t know about your IT operations portfolio that causes dangerous surprises:**

* Your IT servers, storage, apps, and other asset inventory may not be documented, complete, or accurate.
* Your institution’s change control processes and tools don’t notify you of compliance gaps or security vulnerabilities.
* You’re unable to collaborate and communicate security, training, and compliance tasks with your staff or colleagues.
* You don’t know who is responsible and accountable for your assets or who should be informed or consulted about your assets.


Getting security wrong damages your business and brand. Getting compliance wrong risks financial penalties. Maintaining both security and compliance is not easy but it’s simpler than you think.
It begins with focusing on your risks, selecting the right tools, and working with a trusted partner.

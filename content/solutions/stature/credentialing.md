#### Support Your Trial with Impeccable Management

Principal Investigators are the chief researchers and backbone of clinical trials. They are responsible for making final decisions and managing the research funds awarded as part of the research projects. Given these responsibilities, when you hire a PI, there’s little room for error. To ensure a well-run trial, clinical research organizations look for PI candidates with a clean background free of:

* Serious medical mistakes.
* Malpractice cases.
* Criminal lawsuits.
* Conflicts of interest in past research projects.

Stature reduces the risk of invalidating test results due to questions about your PI’s research experience. It captures the entire range of a researcher’s background information, including:

*General medical and research background (education, location, specialty, years of experience, institutions, valid medical licenses and other credentials).
*Subjects and results of previous research investigations and clinical trials.

Clinical Research Organizations (CROs) are not the only ones who need to know about a medical practitioner’s background. Ordinary patients would want to know about their doctors as well. From attitudes to bed side manner to treatment costs, patients now a days want to know all about their doctor before approaching him.

It may also mean a lot to patients to know that their doctors have been board certified, have a valid medical practitioner’s license, have been in practice for so long, have successfully treated or performed procedures on so many patients. It is good to know if their doctors are involved in medical researches, because it may mean that they are experts in the field and would use the knowledge gained through research in treating complex medical conditions. On the flip side, if the doctor is being paid by a drug company for the research, it may also mean that the doctor can administer drugs on you in the interests of the drug company or the doctor.

Stature empowers you with a whole lot of information about your doctor so that you can make informed and better known decisions when deciding on which care provider to visit and go to treatments for.

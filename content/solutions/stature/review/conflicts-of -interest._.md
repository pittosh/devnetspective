It is important to know more about your doctor than the usual reviews before you make an appointment. If your care provider is also involved in medical research, the clinical choices he or she makes can be affected by participation in clinical trials or being paid by drug companies.

When Stature collects other information about your care provider, it flags doctors who might have conflicts of interest so you can be informed before you make an appointment.

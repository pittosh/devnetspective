**If you’re a physician,** you might have concerns about negative reviews or bad press. If these concerns make you wait too long to build a strong profile, your reputation can suffer. To combat negative press, you can use Stature to:

* Take charge of your online reputation.
* Give potential patients the Big Picture about your experience and practice.
* Engage with current and potential patients online.
* Address negative reviews and concerns, quickly and directly.

**If you’re a patient,** you might feel that you don’t know enough about a doctor’s background, experience and reputation. We know that unless these concerns are put to rest, you might look for a provider elsewhere. Stature helps avoid this by enabling you to:

**High-Quality Marketing Content:**

**The “Open, Sesame!” of Modern Selling**

Successful enterprise selling demands content. Lots of it. Brochures, sell sheets, webinars, demonstrations, videos, the list goes on and on. And the amount of it you’ll need to turn prospects into customers might surprise you.

* The CAK helps you find and assemble relevant, high-quality content for your marketing campaigns. It’s the content you’ll need to engage prospects in the all-important first step of the buying process.
* The CAK collects many types of unique and curated content.
* You start the assembly process by identifying the business goals, core audience and industry focus for each marketing campaign. The CAK automates the process by:
  * Performing keyword research, generating keywords and competitor organizations to use or avoid.
  * Using these keywords to identify your target audience and the types of content most likely to engage them.
  * Linking to the feeds that provide targeted content.
  
So, you can spend minutes, not days looking for just the right content that helps meet your marketing goals.

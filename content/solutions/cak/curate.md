**Add Your Voice to Make Content Fresh and Interesting**

Content marketing is a powerful way to engage your audience with unique, compelling information and ideas. But to be effective, content must be fresh and interesting, chosen carefully and aimed at just the right audience.

The Netspective Content Assembler Kit helps you add your unique voice and views to carefully chosen content. Curated content:

* **Makes content more appealing** to your audience by adjusting content to fit your chosen media platform.
* **Makes lead generation easier** by reusing newsletter and other curated content. 

Engage in the digital curation process by:

* **Discovering** digital curators, who you can learn from.
* **Actively exploring** the Internet to find many types of content from many sources.
* **Carefully selecting** digital breadcrumbs of inspiring content.
* **Discarding** everything but the most relevant and engaging content.
* **Enriching** content with your own ideas and experience.

When you’re finished, you’ll get satisfying results: Relevant, engaging content that your audience will value and trust.

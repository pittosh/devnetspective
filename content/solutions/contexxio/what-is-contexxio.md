#### Transforming Data into Comprehensive Care

The Contexxio plug-in functions as a clinical content delivery and patient education platform. Healthcare providers and organizations can use Contexxio to retrieve context sensitive information related to patients’ diagnoses, procedures, medical conditions and health plans. Contexxio uses the information collected from information providers like WebMD, PDR, CME etc to deliver relevant content to EHRs and other digital healthcare systems in real time.

#### Delivering Vital Medical Data in Real Time

**You can install Contexxio as a plug-in to EHR, PHR or any healthcare application. Content is delivered:**

* Directly to physicians at the point of care.
* Directly to patients through their physician-managed PHR.

**Here’s how Contexxio serves up relevant content for healthcare providers or patients:**

* **Data capture.** When a patient or healthcare provider is viewing a patient record in an EHR or any other healthcare app, Contexxio agents installed in the EHR or healthcare app, capture disease- or condition-specific data in the patient’s record—in real time.

* **Data analysis.** This data is passed to the Contexxio server. The server uses rule engines, machine learning, natural language processing and data analytics to process the data.

* **Data Matching.** Contexxio collects and stores information related to specific diseases, illnesses and medical conditions. This includes relevant information on medicines, research results, current treatment trends and other data from the PDR, WebMD, CME (continuing medical education) and many other sources. The Contexxio Server matches the context sensitive data collected from the EHRs with the data it has from various information providers.

* **Data display.** The processed and aggregated information appears in the widgets that viewers see on the EHR pages.

#### Contexxio Data Aggregator and Processor module:

This component analyzes context sensitive data from various information consumers like EHR, PHR, other healthcare applications and data captured from apps running within browsers. Using the information provided by the information providers like WebMD, PDR, CME and others, this module then applies rules to generate information (back to the information consumers) relevant to the captured data.

#### Data Storage module:
This component is responsible for storing the data coming in from the various information consumers. Contexxio uses the Lambda Architecture concept. Lambda Architecture is used to handle massive quantities of data in batch processing mode and real-time streams for urgent review. Contexxio also supports multiple types of data storage models (such as relational data, column stores, and Hadoop like storage).

#### Contexxio applications:
The custom applications can use the incoming data for predictive analysis, disease and population profiling, data auditing etc.

#### Types of Context Sensitive Information

**Contexxio handles these types of information:**

* Patient demographics
* Evidence and assessment clues.
* Signs and symptoms of medical conditions taken from detailed patient histories.
* Nursing procedures
* Results of lab tests and imaging procedures
* Discharge details
* Healthcare staff members (physicians, pharmacists, dieticians, physical therapists, etc.)
* Diagnosed diseases and medical conditions and their ICD codes
* Detailed medication information
* Nursing considerations
* Healthcare plans
* Follow-up care

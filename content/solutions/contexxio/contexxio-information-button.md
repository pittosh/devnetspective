#### A Direct Link to the Best Support Information

Contexxio uses its data analytics capabilities to look for topics in EHR data that are relevant to a specific patient’s care. Then, Contexxio provides links to content that supports current patient treatment and healthcare planning.

Contexxio information buttons provide links on the EHR display to third-party reference information that supports clinical decision making.

#### Find and Display Highly Relevant Content

Contexxio information blocks are widgets displayed prominently on pages of EHR, PHR and other healthcare applications. They consist of context-specific content provided by third-party applications.

Information blocks give healthcare providers immediate access to authoritative content. Quick access to highly relevant support information enables physicians, nurses, dieticians and others to make real-time healthcare decisions and reduce the time needed to provide care.

* Contexxio provides information blocks for different categories of users: patients, doctors, nurses, dieticians and other caregivers.
* The Contexxio application plug-in analyzes EHR records to help find and display content topics that are most relevant to specific patients, healthcare providers and medical conditions.

**Use Contexxio information blocks to display these types of patient-specific content:**

* Relevant articles from WebMD or other Internet sources.
* Detailed drug information to front desk staff (a different presentation than what physicians see).
* CME courses based on the types of patients physicians see each week.
* PDR references based on recent EHR data entries.
* The latest medical research information relevant to physicians’ interests and patients’ conditions.
* Information that helps healthcare providers make prescription decisions in real time.
* Newsletter subscriptions for nurses or other clinicians.

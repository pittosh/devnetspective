#### The Contexxio Rewards Program: Making Compliance Pay

To improve [patient activation](/solutions/contexxio/#pa), Contexxio includes a patient compliance program based on its loyalty and rewards engine. Patients are encouraged to engage fully in their healthcare plan by receiving loyalty points for each program activity they perform and record in their healthcare plan page

**The loyalty and rewards engine:**

* **Tracks patient activity and behavior** within a PHR or other healthcare application.
* **Awards loyalty points** based on patient activity in the system.
* **Defines program rules** about winning and using reward points.
* **Stores reward points** and maintains total points earned.
* **Notifies patients** when they can redeem points for rewards. Patients can choose gifts from the Rewards Marketplace.

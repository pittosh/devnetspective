Patient-generated health data contributes more and more to high-quality healthcare. This is due to the fact that patient data is collected by patients continuously and not by clinicians just during hospital visits. This offers an opportunity to provide information needed during care, with potential cost savings and improvements in quality, care coordination, and patient safety.

**Use Contexxio PGHD capabilities to:**

* **Improve wellness and preventive care.** Data can be captured for all patients whether they are well or at risk or have some chronic condition. This allows Contexxio to provide relevant information for all categories of people by delivering personalized treatment options, risk assessments and other preventive care information irrespective of the condition of their health. For example, well patients can be provided information on health promotions, healthy lifestyle choices and similar educational content. Patients who are at risk can be provided information on weight management, dietary suggestions etc.

* **Provide ongoing patient education.** Contexxio can educate patients on their lifestyles, healthy habits, diet and exercise needs. When patients capture health data from self-monitoring and other wearable devices, Contexxio can provide them with information related to their situation.

* **Motivate patients to take charge of their health care.** Providing personalized health information to patients can go a long way to make them more responsible for their own health care. Given PGHD, Contexxio also provides practical information about what patients can do to improve their condition.

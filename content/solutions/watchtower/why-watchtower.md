When you develop software, something always goes wrong. Always. Face it. In software development, bugs, errors and exceptions are unavoidable. Your process will always be long and complex. And if you develop healthcare software, add another layer of must-haves and must-dos to the usual process and quality requirements.

**Getting quality right—the first time**

In software development, whether it is for regulated markets or otherwise, there’s always a lot to do in very little time. You must keep up with market trends that change constantly. Develop complex applications, platforms and services. Satisfy high and ever-changing quality standards.

**And, you have only one chance to get it right**

Getting it right requires building reliable software and keeping it secure and bug-free. Yes, bugs, errors, flaws and exceptions. Hundreds of them, coming from many sources. Dependable tools and processes are your best (some would say only) defense.

**Netspective Watchtower tools and processes help you defend yourself from unforeseen events that drain your budget and disrupt your development process.**

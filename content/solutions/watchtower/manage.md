Gather and Communicate Test Data Quickly and Easily

Even though software testing is partially automated, it’s still a complex, time-consuming process. Choosing, tracking and communicating test results helps make testing complex and frustrating.

Test leads and product owners often struggle to provide simple, meaningful and reliable testing information to managers and stakeholders. They want to:

* Communicate data that will guide the software testing effort.
* Monitor the progress of testing activities.
* Report status of specific tests.
* Discover gaps in test coverage and areas that might require more investigation.

Modern testing dashboards use powerful analytics and easy-to-use formats that help project managers and stakeholders make faster, more accurate testing and project decisions.

Monitor and Guide Testing from an Easy-to-Use Dashboard


Netspective™ Watchtower uses an analytics-based testing dashboard. We designed Watchtower to reduce testing time and effort. And, we made it easy to communicate high-priority testing information to managers and stakeholders.

Use Watchtower to:

* **Centralize important test data.** Collect results from various test tools in a single, accessible location.
* **Choose and display the most important test results.** We made it easy to select vital data on an accessible, easy-to-configure dashboard.
* **Gain insights into the health of your software.** Just glance at the results on the dashboard for trends that show an increase or decrease in bugs.
* **Judge the status of test case behavior.** Improve your testing process by tracking and eliminating flaky tests.
* **Identify key problem areas.** Help your team fix the most important problems first.
* **Set your own specific quality threshold values.** Select indicator values that tell you whether and when to go live.

Watchtower is easy to integrate with third-party testing tools. Simply import .csv files. Or, use APIs to capture results automatically.

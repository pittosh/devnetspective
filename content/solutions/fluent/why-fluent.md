**Cloud based solutions are adding a learning curve to simple and familiar actions**

* Secure document transfer and custom import/export of files for system integration is becoming difficult.
* Web-based upload models are inconsistent forcing customers to learn new functionalities.
* Familiar actions such as printing a file, saving a file, scanning a file, or snapping pictures via cameras are more preferable than learning new methods.
* Sharing custom files between systems applications requires opening up of insecure ports.

**There’s a need for a secure system that allows**

* Patients to transfer documents to doctor’s offices.
* Doctor’s offices to transfer documents to other doctor’s offices.
* Clients of legal and accounting firms to transfer documents to their lawyers, CPAs or accountants.
* Lawyers and accountants to send documents to each other.
* Customers of any company to transfer documents to their vendors.

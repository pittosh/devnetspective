With a huge increase in the address space with IPv6 and the convergence of wireless technologies, micro-electromechanical systems, and the internet, it is possible to assign a unique identifier to virtually anything on this planet and exchange data among these connected devices. Thus, the emergence of the Internet of Things has opened up infinite possibilities of collecting and gathering insights from data in ways that were not possible before.

Netspectiveâ€™s Fluent IoT Server is the fastest path to advanced IoT solutions. It provides all the back-end functionality that is needed for the communication and management of connected things. It enables data, agent, device and profile management for your connected objects. The Fluent agent is embedded or installed into a connected device which enables the secure exchange of data between the connected thing and the Fluent IoT Server.

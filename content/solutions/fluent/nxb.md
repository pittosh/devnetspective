NXB follows the principle of IFTTT. The Fluent Agent provides NXB using a plug-in architecture framework where you can simply define behaviors and plug it in.

**Use NXB to define behaviors to**

* **Automate tasks** on the cloud. Automatically have your MRI scans delivered to you when they are ready.
* **Automate tasks on your workstations or servers.** Synch new files between systems or servers as they arrive.
* **Work more efficiently.** Share anything from modern apps or legacy applications that don’t know how to share their data.
* **Send out reminders.** Send out daily/weekly/periodic notification emails to your team
* **Share your pictures.** Simply take a picture or a video and instantly share it from your desktop PCs.
* **Create your own workflow.** Scan photos of your office get-togethers and have them be sent to shared locations where the staff can view them.

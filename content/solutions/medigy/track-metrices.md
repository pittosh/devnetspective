Effective data capture and analytics are vital to predicting chances of illness, preventing hospitalization, reducing the rate of re-admissions and ensuring high-quality care. By connecting to your EHR and other clinical systems, Medigy uses the data from these systems to measure differences from standard clinical guidelines and provides preventive care information. Medigy predictive analytics identify patients or groups of patients who are prone to illness and might need care early on.

 **Medigy can help ACOs track quality metrics and improve quality scores.**</br>
 You can use Medigy to:
 
 * **Determine if patients get timely care and appointments** by using data collected from point of care and other systems.
 * **Promote patient health education** by creating a knowledgebase of resources available to patients and clinicians.
 * **Help patients and caregivers work together.** to create an effective patient healthcare plan.
 * **Better understand patient re-admission rates.** Track patient re-admissions by using clinical notes and discharge summaries. This approach helps identify gaps in care, inadequate discharge planning and sub-standard care.
 * **Treat conditions such as asthma and COPD in an outpatient setting.** In outpatient settings, patients with these conditions often donâ€™t get the right treatment. Medigy helps tracks deviations from care adherence in outpatient settings thereby preventing unnecessary hospital admissions.
 * **Make it easier to follow clinical guidelines.**  Medigy monitors for diseases, reduces medication errors and supports better clinical decisions.
 * **Create and maintain medication lists.**  Create a full list of prescription, over-the-counter and herbal medications. Medigy monitors whether patients take medicines as prescribed. If anything has been missed, it can send alerts to caregivers.
 * **Promote preventive care.** For example, you can identify older people who are at risk of falling by tracking balance and gait metrics and alerting physicians for timely intervention.

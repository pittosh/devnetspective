Population Health Management (PHM) focuses on improving the health of defined groups of individuals by the proactive application of strategies and interventions in order to deliver care in a secure, cost effective and clinically effective manner. Large amounts of data are available to hospitals and other healthcare systems. However, providing value to the data and making it available and accessible to physicians at the point of care is key to delivering real time information powered care.

Medigy functions as an EHR add-on leveraging data to redesign care. It helps power clinical decisions to advance patient outcomes, improve quality, and lower costs.

 **Medigy facilitates PHM by making data accessible to physicians at the point of care. Use Medigy to:**
 
  * **Provide a better understanding of patient care**.Provide valuable insights using the data collected from various real time and non real time sources such as EHR, claims, HIE, lab results, marketing data, bioinformatics, medications, health risk assessment responses etc. All collected data is available real time for faster decision making. 
 * **Identify and reconcile conflicts,** duplications and inaccuracies of data collected from various data sources having different data formats. 
 * **Provide aggregated information about care services received outside the PHM network,** referral sources to out-of-network services and cost savings opportunities for in-network care. 
 * **Identify high-risk cohorts with negative health outcomes** and alert stakeholders when the risk is identified. Rank high-risk groups by payers, providers, risk level etc. 
 * **View user-friendly data visualizations** of all types of healthcare data. 
 * **Get a better understanding of patient healthcare costs.** You can compare patient or cohort costs of care with those of similar peers. And advanced data analysis can predict patients or cohorts, whose costs are likely to increase. 
 * **Track specific health goals** set by patients or physicians. 
 * **Encourage patients to participate actively** in their healthcare plans.
 * **Coordinate patient healthcare.**  Medigy notifies healthcare providers of critical changes in patient condition in real time. With Medigy, you can reconcile medications during changes in care. Use Medigy to coordinate and implement clinical workflows and define the roles and responsibilities of physicians involved in the care plan. 
 * **Support pharmacy workflows.** Track and visualize medication use and trigger appropriate notifications. 
 * **Provide well-defined treatment plans,** which can be viewed by anyone engaged in treating the patient. Medigy provides the ability to override the defined protocols based on patient specific treatments. 
 * **Track cohorts  over time** to watch for improvements in care outcomes.

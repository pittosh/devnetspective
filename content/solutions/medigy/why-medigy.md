**Planning medical diagnosis and treatment has always been complex. Consider the variables:**
 
 * The huge volume of medical data captured from patient visits at different points of care.
 * Move patients to different facilities and locations.
 * Add more than one condition at a time.
 * Add changing treatment standards and protocols.
 
**Is there any surprise that data gaps, conflicts and duplications occur? Or that there are differences between treatment provided and industry-standard guidelines?** 
 
<p>There’s a need for a system that:</p>
 
 * Integrates and processes static data (insurance claims, clinical, pharmacy and biographical data) with real-time information (EHR and browser application data).
 * Compares diagnosis and treatment data with well-established standards of care.
 * Describes which guideline steps were omitted, altered or rearranged and why it happened.
 * Makes it easier to get insights from raw data captured from procedures, lab tests and a large number of other events associated with a patient.
 * Links specific types of care to specific patient outcomes.
 

**The Netspective™ Medigy® framework enables healthcare providers and administrators to support and accelerate all of these processes across medical conditions, locations and types of treatment.**

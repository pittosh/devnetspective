 There’s no lack of data in modern healthcare. But your healthcare system probably has many obstacles to using data effectively and improving patient outcomes.

 Start with technology issues such as lack of proper tools, disparate data sources and the need for high-speed, high-volume data analytics. Then add factors such as the lack of advanced workforce skills and your organizational culture. All of these problems can limit your ability to help your patients and help you run your healthcare system more efficiently.

 
**Healthcare Data for Better Decision Making**
 <p>Netspective™ Medigy®, our healthcare data framework, helps you overcome these and other data-related issues. We designed Medigy to help healthcare professionals and organizations use their clinical and operations data to make better decisions.</p>

Here are a few of the many ways to use Medigy in your healthcare system:
 
* **Ensure availability of clinical and support data**. When you use Medigy, you make data easily available for clinical, academic research and benchmarking tasks. 
* **Reduce the rates of hospital acquired infections**. Medigy can use the data collected at the point of care to perform real-time analysis to watch for early signs of infections and to prevent it from progressing. This can be used in pulmonolgy to prevent infections in the ICU and improving patient survival on ventilators. It can also be used in gastroentology and in neonatal units to prevent infections in the ICU. 
* **Prevent setbacks caused by sepsis**. Analyze real-time data from EHRs and other data sources to target high-risk sepsis patients. With this data, physicians can correctly predict septic shocks before any major organs dysfunction. 
* **Prevent Hospital Readmissions**. Use data to better understand why patients in your system are admitted back to the hospital. Then, use it to develop proactive care plans to prevent patients from returning. 
* **Improve post-discharge medical care**. Medigy enables you to develop customized care plans for patients before discharge, track symptoms and conduct early interventions as needed.

With increase in the number of pattern recognition tools over the past decade, it is now possible for converting radiological images into mineable data, called radiomic data, which can be further analyzed for decision support. Early on, images were merely treated as pictures and were interpreted visually. Radiomic data, combined with other kinds of patient data can be used for diagnostic and predictive analysis. Radiomic data is now emerging as a key factor playing a major role in Imaging Decision Support Systems (IDSS).

Netspective IDSS, which is a part of Netspective Medigy, provides a decision support system that gives doctors faster access to the information they need to make quicker, better and informed decisions, thereby providing quality and cost-effective care, resulting in healthier patients.

 **Netspective IDSS is used by radiologists, oncologists as well as researchers in the field of medicine.**

 * **Radiologists**: Studies show that radiologists look at an image every 4 seconds. Netspective IDSS aids radiologists in their decision making process by providing valuable information and deep insights into radiomic data that not only makes their jobs easier and faster, but also reduces errors.

 * **Oncologists**: As knowledge and analytic tools have evolved, radiomics has been able to contribute a lot in the development of decision support systems for oncology. It is able to provide additional information on intensity, shape, size or volume of the tumor than which can be obtained from ordinary clinical reports or lab results. This data can then aid in cancer detection, predictive analysis and in personalized medicine.

 * **Researchers**: In addition to adding an element of speed to their research, Netspective IDSS provides researchers with tools that lets them analyze the images and get extremely infinitesimal details for their research thereby giving them access to a profusion of valuable data like never before.

Genetics holds the promise of healthcare providers finding out which drug is the most effective for each patient and each condition. However, current EHR systems cannot handle genetic information, as well as data standards, security, privacy or scalability. So, there are many problems that must be solved before genomic information can used in medical treatment.

 **However, Medigy can address some of these problems by:**
  
  * **Providing secure access to genomic information**  Because Medigy is an accessory for every MU-compliant, EHR system, itâ€™s easy to add it to your system. 
  * **Getting access to a huge library of genotypic and phenotypic information,** which physicians can use to learn about diseases, provide effective treatments and optimize patient reactions to drugs. 
  * **Processing unstructured genomic data and integrate it.** with existing healthcare information. Medigy uses machine learning and natural language processing to process unstructured genomic data and integrate it with existing healthcare data to provide insights into the data. 
  * **Using SMART on FHIR to retrieve specific clinical data.** exposed through FHIR data layer APIs and making it available to the EHR system. 
  * **Measuring healthcare compliance.** Medigy enables healthcare providers to set up plans, which track how well patients follow specific instructions.

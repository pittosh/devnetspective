Understanding patient behavior plays a major role in improving patient health. This is especially true when providers manage chronic conditions that occur due to unhealthy lifestyles. Wearable devices such as blood pressure sensors enable constant data collection and monitoring of patient health. By using wearables to collect data over time, physicians can better understand patient behavior and its connection to patient health.

Patients are usually diagnosed with a medical history—their own story of diseases, symptoms and conditions. Data from wearable devices can provide additional information, which helps diagnose the patient’s condition better and provide a more appropriate treatment.

 Wearable devices include:
 
 
  * **FDA-regulated medical devices** operated by physicians and care delivery organizations (CDOs). 
  * **Unregulated medical devices** operated by clinicians and CDOs. 
  * **FDA-regulated consumer medical devices**operated by patients (insulin pumps worn on the body). 
  * **Unregulated consumer wearables** operated by patients.Unregulated devices are usually wellness tracking devices. Their use focuses mainly on encouraging a healthy lifestyle rather than curing or treating specific illnesses. The Medigy platform collects data from wellness and regulated devices to improve patient outcomes. 
  
You can use Medigy to:
 
   * **Promote early intervention.** With healthcare costs on the rise, unnecessary hospital visits can be avoided with early intervention. 
   * **Measure patient compliance,** Using data from wearable devices, Medigy can be used to measure the adherence of patients with their care regimen in terms of calorie intake, exercises done etc. 
   * **Document conditions, alert caregivers and collect data**from wearable devices. You can process and adapt data to the needs to the EHR system that receives it. 
   * **Capturing context-sensitive information from wearable devices** This includes device settings and user input, which provides extra information to receiving EHR systems. 
   * **Support several devices** by converting data collected in one format to other formats required by several downstream systems.

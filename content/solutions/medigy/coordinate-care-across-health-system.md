Healthcare providers are using ever-growing volumes of data to understand how they can use this information to improve patient outcomes.

With patient data collected at various points of care, thereâ€™s a lot of information available for analysis. When collected from various sources, this data must be aggregated and reconciled to identify gaps, duplications and conflicts. When data is harmonized, it can be used to improve healthcare coordination and standardization.

 **Use Medigy Care Coordination Services to:**
 
* **Identify data duplications and gaps, treatment conflicts and drug interactions** described in standard clinical protocols. Compare patient treatment events with those recommended in clinical guidelines. Discover and classify gaps in care. Collect care gap information across a population of patients and use data visualization tools to make clinical interpretation easier.
* **Identify conditions that would benefit from early intervention** by using real-time and non-real time data collected from different sources. 
* **Coordinate care for patients with more than one disease or condition.** Manage episodic and chronic care across patient populations and provide long-term support services. 
* **Support wellness education and facilitate faster decision making** by providing access to a knowledge base of evidence.

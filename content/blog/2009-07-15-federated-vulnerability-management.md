The Guerilla CISO blog recently posted a very interesting proposal on [Federated Vulnerability Management][1]. I think it&#8217;s a fantastic idea that should be seriously considered. If we use modern linked open data through some secure network channels I think we could make this happen without writing much code and getting all the agency data we need through RESTful mashup technologies. We wouldn&#8217;t need any centralized servers and could really do it in a decentralized but fully federated and integrated way. 

For architects, the relevant paragraph from the posting was the following:

> Security architecture models (FEA anyone?) that show federated patch and vulnerability management deployments as part of their standard configuration. OK with the firewall pictures and zones of trust, I understand what you&#8217;re saying, now give me patch and vulnerability management flows across all the zones so I can do the other 85% of my job.

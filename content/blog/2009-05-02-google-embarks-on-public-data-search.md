Google [buy paroxetine online][1], [order clomid][2] [says it&#8217;s going to make public government data searchable][3] and is going to allow the general population to visualize the data. Starting with population and unemployment data, it says more is on the way. This is similar to the vision that Vivek Kundra has with his concept of data.gov &#8212; it will be interesting to see which one the public uses more and which data set Google puts higher in search results.

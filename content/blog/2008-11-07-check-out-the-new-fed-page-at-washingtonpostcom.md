The Washington Post just launched <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/fedpage" target="_blank">The Fed Page</a>, a new sub-site that uses charts, figures, online tools, blogs, and interactive features to examine the inner workings of the federal government. If you&#8217;re a federal architect, especially an EA, you&#8217;ll need to keep track of what changes the new Obama Administration will bring forth so it&#8217;s important to keep an eye on sites like this to know how the business of government might be conducted in the future.

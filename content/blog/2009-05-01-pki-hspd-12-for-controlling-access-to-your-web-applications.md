If you&#8217;re looking for a quick and easy way to allow web applications to use your PIV cards and allow more thin-client solutions be HSPD-12 compliant, check out the [Public Key Infrastructure Framework (PKIF)][1] and [WebCullis][2] projects.

What&#8217;s slick about WebCullis is that it&#8217;s an IIS- and Apache-compatible web module that makes most of the process transparent. Here&#8217;s what the developers say about the projects, verbatim from their website:

<span class="caps">PKIF</span> provides a variety of capabilities useful in enabling applications, including:

  * Certification path building and discovery compatible with the DoD <span class="caps">PKI</span> and the Federal bridged environments.
  * <span class="caps">RFC 5280</span>-compliant path validation.
  * Supports <span class="caps">RFC 3852</span> (Cryptographic Message Syntax).
  * Supports <span class="caps">RFC 3161</span> (Timestamp protocol).
  * <span style="color: red;">New</span> Supports <span class="caps">RFC 5055</span> (SCVP) and <span class="caps">RFC 4998</span> (ERS) along with <span class="caps">RFC 5276</span> (SCVP/ERS wantBacks)
  * wxWidgets-based cross-platform <span class="caps">GUI</span> controls.
  * Enabling applications is simple.
  * Multiple certificate sources are supported, including <span class="caps">LDAP</span>-accessible directories, web servers, <span class="caps">CAPI</span> certificate stores, <span class="caps">NSS</span> certificate stores and other application-specified sources.
  * Can retrieve revocation information from local stores, application-specified sources (such as an <span class="caps">LDAP</span> directory) and follow <span class="caps">CRL</span> distribution points.
  * Can use <span class="caps">OCSP</span> responders specified in <span class="caps">AIA</span> extensions.
  * One or more trusted <span class="caps">OCSP</span> responder(s) may be configured for path validation.
  * Configurable to make the most of your infrastructure.
  * Configurations can be created centrally and pushed out using your existing management tools.
  * Much more. See the online developer&#8217;s reference for details.

Webcullis provides a simple, secure and flexible solution for integrating your <span class="caps">PKI</span> and your web aplications. Webcullis Feature:

  * Certification path building and discovery compatible with the DoD <span class="caps">PKI</span> and the Federal bridged environments.
  * <span class="caps">RFC 3280</span>-compliant path validation
  * Cached validations to reduce server load for multiple requests
  * Simple configuration syntax
  * Access restrictions may be based on: Name constraints, Key Size, Extended Key Usage, Policy Constraints or Quality of revocation information
  * Allows the use of one or more <span class="caps">LDAP</span> directories for path building
  * One or more trusted <span class="caps">OCSP</span> responders may be configured for path validation
  * Webcullis trust roots are separate from the system trust roots, enabling server-side work-arounds for client-side bugs.
  * Access to resources may be controlled without configuring cumbersome mappings between certificates and system accounts on <span class="caps">IIS</span>.

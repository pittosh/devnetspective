The [Agenda][1] for the [Cloud Computing Interoperability Workshop][2] on March 23 in Crystal City, Virginia is now online. Strategies and Technologies for Cloud Computing Interoperability (SATCCI) is a Workshop for Federal Computing Stakeholders. 

The Obama Administration in general and the new Federal CIO specifically have espoused the benefits of cloud computing in government. If you&#8217;re interested in cloud computing and how it might apply to your federal architecture environment, please plan on attending.

If you&#8217;d like to propose contents, suggest questions that [order paxil][3], [online Zoloft][4] need to be answered, etc. please post them here and I will be happy to pass them along to the organizers.

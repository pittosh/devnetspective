To install the package on Ubuntu, run the following command:

sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator

Activate Google Authenticator

Next you&#8217;ll have to require Google Authenticator for SSH logins. To do so, open the/etc/pam.d/sshd file on your system (for example, with the sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd command) and add the following line to the file:

auth required pam\_google\_authenticator.so

Next, open the sshd_config file, locate theChallengeResponseAuthentication line, and change it to read as follows:

ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

(If the ChallengeResponseAuthentication line doesn&#8217;t already exist, add the above line to the file.)

Finally, restart the SSH server so your changes will take effect:

sudo service ssh restart

Create an Authentication Key
  
Log in as the user you&#8217;ll be logging in with remotely and run the google-authenticatorcommand to create a secret key for that user.
  
Finally, restart the SSH server so your changes will take effect:

google-authenticator

Google Authenticator will present you with a secret key and several emergency scratch codes. Write down the emergency scratch codes somewhere safe they can only be used one time each, and they&#8217;re intended for use if you lose your phone.
  
Phone:

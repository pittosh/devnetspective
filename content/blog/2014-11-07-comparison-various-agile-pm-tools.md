Running an agile enterprise IT team requires robust and business specific responsive tools which follow a business oriented software development approach and improvisation of overall communication between the team. There are a lot of free as well as paid agile tools in the market. Choosing one that best meets your needs can be quite daunting at times. In our quest for finding the right tool that would fit our needs, we evaluated a few of the popular agile PM tools. Here&#8217;s the comparison table that came out of our study:

                    Though AgileFant is simple to use, the lack of adding acceptance criteria makes it undesirable.

                    Though difficult for novice users, the option for adding acceptance criteria suits our requirements.</p>

                      Also their PRO version has integration option with Mantis.

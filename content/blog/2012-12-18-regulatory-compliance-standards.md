      The United States regulatory environment for the Government, Healthcare and Medical technology industries is a robust one with well laid out standards and best practices and sometimes cumbersome and complex requirements. These regulatory mandates are being evaluated and modified today to accommodate the changes affected by technology within these industries. FDA, HIPAA, ICD, ARRA, HITECH and many others have a major role to play in these industries. It is now up to the participants in these industries to understand and leverage them to their business advantage.

      The vast number of guidelines or standards issued for effective healthcare compliance programs makes it difficult for developing, implementing and measuring an effective compliance program. There are solutions in the market, but these have to be tuned to your business requirements as organizations need to conduct ongoing auditing and monitoring of the health care compliance programs to ensure effectiveness.

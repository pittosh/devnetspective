As architects we&#8217;re routinely asked about the &#8220;best tool for the job.&#8221; More and more these days the answer is a scripting language like Perl or Ruby &#8212; and, without a wink or cringing about it. Even as little as ten years ago those of us who liked scripting languages only recommended it for small utilities or daily script work &#8212; however, more and more these days scripting languages are being used to deliver entire services in a SOA or WOA environment and even build complete applications. I still think that scripting is for specialized domain-specific uses but others believe that scripting can be used for general-purpose use cases, too. 

Check out this CIO Magazine article &#8220;<a href="http://www.cio.com/article/446829/PHP_JavaScript_Ruby_Perl_Python_and_Tcl_Today_The_State_of_the_Scripting_Universe?contentId=446829&slug=&" target="_blank">PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Python, and Tcl Today: The State of the Scripting Universe</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s got some good content and thoughts from the creators or managers of the projects that the scripting languages come from.

There are several significant changes occurring in the Healthcare industry, but very few have a direct impact to your earning potential like the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10. While there have been many conversations focusing on the need for this upcoming ICD-10 transition, few have got into analyzing the risk and positive impacts to the business of healthcare.

If you have not started, or are in the process of making the ICD-10 transition, you need to know how to prepare your organization for this big change and assess the impacts in real business numbers.

Hello Health teamed up with Netspective to talk about [ICD-10 and the Revenue Connection][1]. Fred Pennic, a leader in ICD-10 transition, Healthcare IT consultant and a prolific writer on various topics about Healthcare IT, led this webinar.

Their shared objective was to provide advice on how to make the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10, understand the revenue impacts from this change, and learn how this transition will help you manage business risk. This webinar reviewed important considerations for ICD-10 readiness to help your staff remain focused and avoid any revenue hiccups.

Netspective covered a lot of ground and provided numerous tips and tricks to plan or improve your strategy for this ICD -10 transition. The recommended approach is to focus on three things People, Process and Technology. We understand that change management is a big challenge in this transition process, and discuss about how hard it is to rise above the daily grind; how to get the organization rallied for this change, how to build a measurable ICD -10 transition plan, and how to deploy this change across your organizations ecosystem.

[Please see the Webinar on ICD 10 transition that took place on Wednesday, April 17th here][1].

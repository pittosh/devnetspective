As architects working on federal projects we spend a ton of time on security practices and FISMA compliance. Implementing FISMA guidelines involves lots of manual tracking of dozens of steps and checks across various groups. I was pleased to run across [OpenFISMA][1] recently because it helps automate some of the manual steps in FISMA compliance by using a LAMP-based application to manage the process. OpenFISMA also guides requirements-gathering activities, such as verifying compliance with requirements, security assessments and vulnerability remediation. Here&#8217;s the description of the tool from their website:

> The OpenFISMA project is an open source application designed to reduce the complexity and automate the regulatory requirements of the [Federal Information Security Management Act][2] (FISMA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [Risk Management Framework][3] (RMF). 
> 
> OpenFISMA [order dapoxetine online cheap][4], [buy dapoxetine online][5] contains many of the NIST SP 800-53 security controls required for a FIPS-199 "high" impact information system. This helps you get your OpenFISMA instance authorized to operate quickly. The built-in controls include system use notification, rules of behavior, electronic privacy policy (p3p), and many, many more.
> 
> OpenFISMA also contains a catalog of all NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 2 controls built-in. Findings in OpenFISMA can be matched against these security controls to provide supplemental information for remediation and planning. The catalog includes descriptions of the controls, scoping, and supplemental guidance.

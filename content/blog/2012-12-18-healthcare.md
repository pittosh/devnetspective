      <p>
        The business of healthcare continues to get more complex as patients, providers, public health payers, regulators, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, pharmacy and technology companies become more connected with each other and directly affect health outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to extend next generation care to patients, healthcare needs to drive rapid reforms with all care associated entities focusing on implementing regulation mandates, bringing workflow integration, creating and implementing new processes and automating them with adequate privacy and security measures to protect patient data to improve clinical intelligence and quality of care.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The focus of healthcare providers, pharmaceutical and medical device firms is to reduce healthcare cost with greater emphasis on evidence based metrics. These industries see healthcare IT innovations, like mHealth, Telehealth, EHR and EMR, Process Automation, Patient Portals, and Medical Device Integration, as providers of new business opportunities. However, these innovations require strategic thinking in order to deliver value to patients, providers and payers in the future. A good approach would be to respond to these dynamics through multiple, concurrent strategies that include alliances and partnerships across their entire value chain.

    New Models in Healthcare &#8211; HIE, ACO, PCMH, PCPPC
  </h2>
  
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Large healthcare provider groups, academic medical centers, community hospitals and small or individual practice provider organizations are re-engineering their business operations and automation initiatives to improve their clinical operations and the quality of care. These re-engineering initiatives also focus on keeping operating costs to a minimum. The ultimate objective of these organizations are to enable the creation and adoption of new business models, health information exchanges(HIE), accountable care organizations(ACO), e-consulting enablement, access to clinical analytics, medical homes (PCMH) and seamless systems interoperability in order to achieve patient-centered care (PCPPC).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The primary focus of healthcare providers need to be on the incentives for electronic health record (EHR) adoption for Meaningful Use and the integration of information across practices through HIE or ACO models. Healthcare business and clinical leaders need to evaluate these challenges and make decisions necessary to protect their core businesses while providing patient centered wellness and effective patient care.

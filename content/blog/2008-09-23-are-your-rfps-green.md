Reducing energy consumption for [generic priligy][1], [lioresal reviews][2] IT (&#8220;greening&#8221;) is a major cost containment issue &#8212; something we&#8217;ll need to do in the times of budget cuts that are probably on the way. One key to achieving &#8220;green&#8221; in IT is the green request for proposal (RFP). The government should be driving energy efficiency in desktop and data center environments and use the RFP process to gain energy efficiency as part of their green IT goals. OMB hasn&#8217;t really mandated any &#8220;green IT goals&#8221; yet but I think they&#8217;re coming, especially if there&#8217;s a Democrat administration on the way (but even if it&#8217;s McCain).

Using RFPs is valuable for IT and it signals which areas the government might intend to push its vendors in the future. Commercial and Federal buyers should seek progressive energy efficiencies and cleaner manufacturing processes by pushing green across suppliers.

I presented this opinionated look at why the Medicare Shared Savings plans, ACOs and other outcomes-driven payment models are being promoted over fee for service (FFS) models and what that means for service providers and integrators. Evidence driven healthcare is required to help reduce costs and data drives evidence – the problem is that institutions are having trouble pulling together all the data they need. Current health IT systems integrate poorly and anyone that can improve that data integration to help with pricing transparency, cost transparency, care coordination, and population health management will have work for years.

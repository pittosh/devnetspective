Presented at HxRefactored 2015, Boston, MA. Key takeaways:

* Any enterprise app which acts like a consumer app that doesn’t integrate well into hospital or ambulatory systems and workflows is doomed

* There’s nothing unique about health IT data that justifies complex, expensive, or special technology.

* There’s a lot unique about healthcare workflows that require common technologies to be adapted properly.

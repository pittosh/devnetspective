This was presented at Health 2.0's HxRefactored 2014 Conference in Brooklyn.

Background: 
* Many enterprise apps are being built these days, but most are designed to work as a stand alone system similar to consumer apps 
* Healthcare-specific software engineering and integration tools are going to do more harm than good (industry-neutral is better).

Key Takeaways: 
* Any enterprise app which acts like a consumer app that doesn’t integrate well into hospital or ambulatory systems and workflows is doomed 
* There’s nothing unique about health IT data that justifies complex, expensive, or special technology. 
* There’s a lot unique about healthcare workflows that require common technologies to be adapted properly.

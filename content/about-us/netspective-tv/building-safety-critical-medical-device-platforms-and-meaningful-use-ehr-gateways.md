## Description
This is an in depth technical presentation delivered at OSCon 2012 on how to define, design, and build modern safety-critical medical device platforms and Meaningful Use compliant EHR gateways. The talk starts with a quick background on comparative effective research (CER) and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and the kinds of data the government is looking to leverage in the future to help reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes. After defining why data is important, the workshop will cover the different techniques for collecting medical data – such as directly from a patient, through healthcare professionals, through labs, and finally through medical devices; the presentation will cover which kinds of data are easy to collect and what are more difficult and how technical challenges to collection can be overcome.

After covering the data collection area the workshop will dive deep into a modern medical device platform architecture which the speaker calls “The Ultimate Medical Device Connectivity Architecture” – providing an in-depth overview and answering questions around architecture, specifications, and design or modern (connected) medical devices.

Presentations of open source software and other inexpensive design techniques for implementing connected architectures will be covered. Finally, the talk will cover details about medical device gateways, what new Meaningful Use rules might require when connecting EHRs to gateways, and how to design and architect gateways that can stand the test of time and be interoperable over the long haul.

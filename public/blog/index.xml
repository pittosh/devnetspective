      <description>There&amp;#8217;s been plenty of discussion in both literature and general media about &amp;#8220;most software projects failing.&amp;#8221; There are plenty of reasons for failed projects: from inadequate requirements gathering to poor project management to plain incompetence. Some of the problem starts at the C-Suite where projects are actually identified and started &amp;#8212; for asking to automate (presumably with software) something that maybe has no business being automated.
My simple advice to most architects, CTOs, CEOs and CIOs about project management starts with a question: can you methodically and manually repeat the thing you are trying to automate?</description>

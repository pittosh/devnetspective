      <description>With limited availability of expertise and dedicated resources in the regulatory compliance space, most organizations are not able to keep up with the ever-changing compliance requirements. Additionally, the regulations across countries vary and so marketing products across geographies will need knowledge and implementation of these country specific regulations. As a result of the challenges involved in complying with the regulations and industry standards like ARRA, HIPAA, HITECH and SOX, enterprises find it difficult to bring their products out into the market in a short period of time.</description>

      <description>Before they put software into production, many enterprises conduct an Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;amp;V) process to make sure it’s bulletproof.
To conduct IV&amp;amp;V testing, IT and Product organizations in regulated industries like Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology hire third parties with no ties to the professionals who developed the software. These third parties provide a clear, unbiased analysis of software solutions being built. Testers not only verify that software is built correctly, they make sure you’re building the right product.</description>

      <description>The past few years have seen drastic changes in testing methodologies. Organizations are moving towards test automation in order to save on cost and time. Enterprises are analyzing every phase of the testing life cycle to find out the areas that can be automated by using tools. From initial automated testing strategies where scripting knowledge was required to write scripts to automate testing, the testing industry has gone to making script less testing frameworks.</description>

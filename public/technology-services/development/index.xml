      <description>A good architecture design should fit in with your legacy systems and products, and should build on what has proven to work. The architecture should also enhance the value of your past investments in technology and processes and exploit opportunities for reuse within the system and across systems. This is especially true in the Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology Industries, wherein regulatory evironment and diverse needs require a well planned scalable solution to be put in place.</description>

      <description>In the healthcare industry, the integration among the disparate Healthcare delivery systems has been a challenge for some time now. Devices such as the vital sign monitors and infusion pumps use custom protocols that are not designed for interoperability. The want of mandatory standards for these systems result in critical medical information being lost or inaccessible from these systems. Most importantly, the information is not available to the physicians real-time.</description>

      <description>At Netspective, weâ€™ve developed user interface design into a fine art, focusing not only on the functions that a software system needs to provide, but also the way in which it presents them to users.
How our UI design process works When we work on your UI design, we follow a thorough, carefully-defined process which produces consistent results.
First, the graphics team creates multiple design templates for review by the client.</description>

      <description>Up until a couple of years ago, there were no web sharing sites or applications. Information published or consumed on the web merely consisted of static web pages. This paradigm has undergone a drastic transformation with websites now being areas of active discussion, collaboration and interaction.
This new model of content sharing sites, together called Web 2.0, is drastically changing the way people interact with each other. Web 2.0 opens up a whole new world of possibilities.</description>

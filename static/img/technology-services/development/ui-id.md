At Netspective, weâ€™ve developed user interface design into a fine art, focusing not only on the functions that a software system needs to provide, but also the way in which it presents them to users.

### How our UI design process works

When we work on your UI design, we follow a thorough, carefully-defined process which produces consistent results.

First, the graphics team creates multiple design templates for review by the client. Once the template is approved, the UI team will build CSS classes that support different scripting languages like JavaScript and VBScript, and convert the design templates into HTML code that can be incorporated into the web application. To improve the manageability, readability and customization of the interfaces, the CSS classes and script code will be kept in separate files.

Once constructed, we check the interface for alignment defects using tools like jRuler and FastStone. We then test the interface at various screen resolutions and also check it for compatibility with popular browsers like IE, Mozilla, Safari and Chrome. The completed interface will be quick to load, SEO-ready, W3C validated and Section 508 compliant.

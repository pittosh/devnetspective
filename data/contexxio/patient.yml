title: Patient Activation
paragraph: >
 <h4>Patients: Get Up, Get Real, Get Activated.</h4>
 <p>Healthcare costs are rising. It’s essential that patients make the most of each healthcare dollar they spend. That means understanding and following their healthcare plan. Patient activation programs encourage and support patients in their ongoing care. It keeps them better informed about their condition and helps them play an active role in their healthcare.</p>

 <p>Activated patients are engaged. They are better able to communicate with their caregivers, experience fewer medical errors, receive better care and are generally better satisfied with their healthcare system.</p>

 <p><strong>Education and better support from caregivers go a long way in increasing patient activation. Getting patients activated means:</strong></p>
 <ul>
 <li>Making them aware of their health problems.</li>
 <li>Explaining how their daily lives are affected by their current condition.</li>
 <li>Describing their treatment options.</li>
 <li>Getting them to take a more active role in improving their health.</li>
 </ul>

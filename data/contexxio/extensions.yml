  <strong>Overcome Obstacles to Easy Data Access</strong>
  <p>Although it’s common to add Contexxio to an EMR, EHR or PHR system, some healthcare facilities don’t permit this. You can avoid this obstacle by using the Contexxio browser extension.</p>

  <p>Healthcare providers can add the extension to their browser and enjoy the same functionality that they would get by using the Contexxio plug-in. The extension automatically identifies the healthcare application running on the browser, captures the information and links it to relevant resources or information.</p>
  <p><strong>Because caregivers use, different browsers, Contexxio extensions are available for:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Microsoft® Internet Explorer®</li>
  <li>Microsoft Edge®</li>
  <li>Mozilla® Firefox®</li>
  <li>Google Chrome™</li>
  <li>Apple Safari®</li>
  </ul>

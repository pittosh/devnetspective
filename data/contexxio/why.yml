title: Why Contexxio?
subtitle: >
  Without context, healthcare data will never work for you.
paragraph: >
  <p>There’s more medical data than ever, but it’s getting harder to make it useful. Often, that’s because electronic records information can’t be easily linked to information that’s relevant to specific patients, healthcare providers, medical conditions or types of treatment.</p>

  <p>Contexxio provides effective EHR-based solutions, which overcome these and other information delivery problems. Use Contexxio to provide healthcare professionals and patients with:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Highly relevant medical information</strong> targeted at specific patients or healthcare providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical content</strong> that can be integrated easily into patient EHR systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Patient-specific medical advice and healthcare plans,</strong> which patients will engage and comply with.</li>
    <li><strong>Data utilization analytics,</strong> which enable healthcare organizations to monetize clinical content.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Contexxio design and operation emphasizes ease of use and lots of choice.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>A focus on easy use.</strong> Contexxio design focuses on easy installation, use and training instead of bells-and-whistle features.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for one physician or hundreds.</strong> We have built Contexxio with modern, open-source web technologies that are scalable and robust. So, no matter how many healthcare providers work in your system, Contexxio operates across healthcare systems and geographic boundaries.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>No More Generic Patient Education Content</h4>
  <p>Generic healthcare information no longer makes the grade. Instead, patient education content must be selected to address each patient’s concerns and support ongoing care. Contexxio patient education materials include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Detailed, up-to-date medication information</li>
  <li>Healthcare plan information and healthcare tips, including exercise</li>
  <li>New research information that applies to ongoing patient care</li>
  </ul>
